## What is Waves API Collection VST RTAS v1.0?
 
Waves API Collection VST RTAS v1.0 is a set of audio plugins developed by Waves in association with Automated Processes Incorporated (API), the company that created some of the most revered analog hardware in the music industry. The plugins are based on the API 550A and 550B equalizers, the API 560 graphic equalizer, and the API 2500 stereo compressor. These plugins can be used in any VST or RTAS compatible host, such as Pro Tools, Cubase, FL Studio, Ableton Live, and more.
 
The plugins offer the same sonic quality and flexibility as the original hardware, but with some added features and benefits. For example, you can switch in the subtle harmonic distortion and hiss of the original hardware for extra color and vibe[^2^]. You can also use presets from top producers, mixers and mastering engineers like Steve Lillywhite, Tony Maserati, Greg Wells, and Drew Lavyne[^2^]. Moreover, you can save CPU power and disk space by using only one plugin instead of four.
